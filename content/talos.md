Talos is a modern Linux distribution designed to be secure, immutable, and minimal. All system management is done via API, and there is no shell or interactive console. Some of the capabilities and benefits provided by Talos include:

* Security: Talos reduces your attack surface by practicing the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) and by enforcing mutual TLS for all communication between Talos components.
* Predictability: Talos eliminates unneeded variables and reduces unknown factors in your environment by using immutable infrastructure for Talos host components.
* Evolvability: Talos simplifies your architecture and increases your ability to easily accommodate future changes to your configuration and environment.

For details on the various components that make up Talos, please see the pages in the "Components" section of the documentation.

To get started quickly using a local Docker-based environment, please see our [Getting Started Guide]({{< ref "guides/getting_started.md" >}}).
